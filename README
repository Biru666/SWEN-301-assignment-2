In this project, I chose json.org because it is simple and human-readable. 
Comparing with other libraries, json.org is very basic.
It just like the role of Array in Collections. In the final project of SWEN 225, I've tried to use
gson and jackson to parse the map. However, the parsers of these two libraries don't parse data
directly but need some more operations. With json.org, I can easily parse and generate
Json data because its methods are easy for humans to read and write. 

Because json.org is a tree-type library, then its structure is very stable. In some projects 
with small data, people are more likely to use json.org because it uses the least
memories.
